## Overview and Origin

Lemonade Inc. was incorporated in April 2015 by co-founders Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger. Both co-founders have had previous experience in the growing tech ecosystem due to previous ventures with Daniel being the former president of Powermat Technologies Limited, a developer for wireless power solutions, and Shai, who was best known for his role co-founding Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelance services. Powermat is based in Tel Aviv while Fiverr[(NYSE:FVRR)](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:FVRR) is a publicly-traded company. Lemonade[(NYSE:LMND)]( https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:LMND) had its IPO this year on July 2nd on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol of LMND. On the primary market, Lemonade opened at $29 and ended the trading day at $69.41. 

Co-founders, met through a mutual friend in 2014 was Schreiber was in the market to start up a new business venture. Upon initial interaction, Schreiber was taken aback by Wininger's track record and expertise in product design and IT infrastructure.

Both Shai (Wininger, my co-founder) and I are veterans of the tech ecosystem and knew nothing about insurance when we first started."

Lemonade has had a total of seven funding rounds that have raised a total of $480 million. Over the seven rounds of funding, the company has gathered support from 17 investors with SoftBank Group, the Japanese multinational conglomerate being lead investors.[^3](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lemonade/company_financials#investors)

## Business Activities

Lemonade seeks to change the perception of the insurance industry while turning it from what many may see as a necessary evil and turning it into a social good. By using their incredible quantities of data inputs, Lemonade seeks to offer customer-tailored policies to meet each client's specific needs for the lowest cost. In doing so, Lemonade not only provides a service but leaves customers with the feeling of satisfaction wrought from finding one of the best deals available. On top of this, Lemonade takes only 25% of the insurance premium revenue for administrative costs and profits while leaving the remaining 75% to fund customer claims, buy reinsurance, and pay various taxes and fees. Anything leftover is then given to charities that customers are allowed to choose. [^4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/05/02/lemonade-fintech-insurance-unicorn/#2206b6606cde) While the law of large numbers states that with an increase in clients, there will naturally be more claims that will require Lemonade to payout, having customers come face to face with the possibility of stealing from charities they chose themselves, Lemonade leaves the onus choosing to falsify claims up to the individuals. Using pre-existing social structures to cause others to police themselves gives the new insurance company a leg up on competitors.  

## Landscape
The global InsurTech landscape currently consists of many players with each new start-up seeking to give a unique experience that the traditional companies lack. Lemonade exists in a position where its offerings are both niche in operation but broad in the application scope. Even though the number of products currently available are small, they are essential insurance policies for everyone that pays rent or mortgage. [^6](https://www.lemonade.com/) This allows them to focus on competition with fewer firms while building a trusted brand. 

## Results

This company operates squarely in the InsurTech industry. By utilizing their advances in algorithmic learning to meet individual customers' needs, Lemonade has created a unique space in which customers feel comfortable paying what they perceive to be the best price for only policies that best fit their exact needs. That being said, Lemonade has yet to prove that it has the potential for longterm sustainability in an industry that has seen its most prominent players withstand the test of time. With all the bells and whistles that Lemonade brings to the table, it still operates as a standard insurance company, except they offer a fancy promise of charitable donations to customers and show balance sheets indicated net losses to shareholders.[^5](https://insnerds.com/lemonade-hype/) While revolutionary in its proprietary use of advancements in technology, when it comes to insurance, it can still be seen as an "old man's game". The inability to speak to a human being, whether on the phone or in person, that will empathize with your plight may be a more massive detriment rather than a boon in the long run that prevents them from ever truly taking significant portions of market share.  

## Recommendations

Moving forward, my professional suggestions for Lemonade are to continue its current expansion into the market, regardless of the balance sheet. As of current, Lemonade is not a profitable business. However, it currently places itself in the position to utilize its affordable insurance policies for renters and homeowners as a loss leader strategy. Insurance companies traditionally make significant profits based on an economy of scale. While accepting a loss on renters' insurance, Lemonade poises itself as a true disrupter by using its technological advantage to attract new customers to bundle their insurance policies and take on other offerings. This will lead Lemonade to possess to coveted reoccurring revenue bundle, which will increase revenue and make up for losses on the net loss product offerings. 
These big-ticket items like auto-insurance and even life-insurance would be added to this bundle in the future and could allow for collaboration or even buy-outs of start-ups that use data-driven learning as a means to offer better life-insurance packages to customers. I believe this to be the best and only way forward for Lemonade as an insurance company as they will eventually need to prove their ability not just to generate revenue but also to turn a profit to meet the expectations of shareholders.
