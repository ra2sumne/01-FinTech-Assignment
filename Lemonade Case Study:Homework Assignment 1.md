# Lemonade: Industry Disruptor?
### Rawlric Sumner

## Overview and Origin

Lemonade Inc. was incorporated in April 2015 by co-founders Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger. Both co-founders have had previous experience in the growing tech ecosystem due to previous ventures with Daniel being the former president of Powermat Technologies Limited, a developer for wireless power solutions, and Shai who was best known for his role in co-founding Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelance services. Powermat is based in Tel Aviv while Fiverr[(NYSE:FVRR)](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:FVRR) is a publicly traded company. Lemonade[(NYSE:LMND)]( https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:LMND) had its IPO this year on July 2nd on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol of LMND. On the primary market, Lemonade opened at price of $29 and ended the trading day at $69.41. 

Co-founders, met through a mutual friend in 2014 was Schreiber was in the market to start up a new business venture. Upon initial interaction, Schreiber was taken aback by Wininger’s track record and expertise in the fields of product design and IT infrastructure.[^1](https://productmint.com/the-lemonade-insurance-business-model-how-does-lemonade-insurance-make-money/#:~:text=Shai%20Wininger%20and%20Daniel%20Schreiber,on%20in%20Tel%20Aviv%2C%20Israel.&text=Instead%20of%20selling%20insurance%20policies,become%20a%20licensed%20carrier%20itsel) When later recounting the origins of the now publicly traded insurance company, Schreiber, in an interview with Forbes, states, “Insurance was not an obvious place to innovate, and the industry has gone largely untouched by technology for more than an century. Both Shai (Wininger, my cofounder) and I are veterans of the tech ecosystem and knew nothing about insurance when we first started.” [^2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/afdhelaziz/2020/03/09/the-power-of-purpose-how-lemonade-is-disrupting-insurance-with-goodness-and-a-new-foundation/#554b53417288) Due to both founders’ lack of experience in the insurance industry, Ty Sagalow, the CEO and founder of Innovation Insurance Group, was hired as the Chief Insurance Officer of Lemonade to aid in getting everything on the right track.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

## Recommendations

Moving forward, my professional suggestions for Lemonade are to continue its current expansion into the market, regardless of the balance sheet. As of current, Lemonade is not a profitable business. However, it currently places itself in the position to utilize its affordable insurance policies for rent and homeowners as a loss leader strategy. Insurance companies traditionally make significant profits based on an economy of scale. Why accepting a loss on renter's insurance, Lemonade poises to place itself as a true disrupter by using its technological advantage to attract new customers to bundle their insurance policies and take on other offerings. This will lead Lemonade to possess to coveted reoccuring revenue bundle which will increase revenue and make up for losses on the net loss product offerings. 
These big ticket items like auto-insurance and even life-insurance would be added to this bundle in the future and could allow for collaboration or even buy-outs of start-ups that use data driven learning as a means to offer better life-insurance packages to customers. I believe this to be the best and only way forward for Lemonade as an insurance company as they will eventually need to prove their ability to not just generate revenue but turn a profit in order to meet the expectations of shareholders.
