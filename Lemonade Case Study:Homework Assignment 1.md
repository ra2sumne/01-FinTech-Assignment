## Overview and Origin

Lemonade Inc. was incorporated in April 2015 by co-founders Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger. Both co-founders have had previous experience in the growing tech ecosystem due to previous ventures with Daniel being the former president of Powermat Technologies Limited, a developer for wireless power solutions, and Shai who was best known for his role in co-founding Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelance services. Powermat is based in Tel Aviv while Fiverr[(NYSE:FVRR)](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:FVRR) is a publicly traded company. Lemonade[(NYSE:LMND)]( https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:LMND) had its IPO this year on July 2nd on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol of LMND. On the primary market, Lemonade opened at price of $29 and ended the trading day at $69.41. 

Co-founders, met through a mutual friend in 2014 was Schreiber was in the market to start up a new business venture. Upon initial interaction, Schreiber was taken aback by Wininger’s track record and expertise in the fields of product design and IT infrastructure.[^1](https://productmint.com/the-lemonade-insurance-business-model-how-does-lemonade-insurance-make-money/#:~:text=Shai%20Wininger%20and%20Daniel%20Schreiber,on%20in%20Tel%20Aviv%2C%20Israel.&text=Instead%20of%20selling%20insurance%20policies,become%20a%20licensed%20carrier%20itsel) When later recounting the origins of the now publicly traded insurance company, Schreiber, in an interview with Forbes, states, “Insurance was not an obvious place to innovate, and the industry has gone largely untouched by technology for more than an century. Both Shai (Wininger, my cofounder) and I are veterans of the tech ecosystem and knew nothing about insurance when we first started.” [^2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/afdhelaziz/2020/03/09/the-power-of-purpose-how-lemonade-is-disrupting-insurance-with-goodness-and-a-new-foundation/#554b53417288) Due to both founders’ lack of experience in the insurance industry, Ty Sagalow, the CEO and founder of Innovation Insurance Group, was hired as the Chief Insurance Officer of Lemonade to aid in getting everything on the right track. 
Lemonade has had a total of seven funding rounds that have raised a total of $480 million. Over the seven rounds of funding, the company has gathered support from 17 investors with SoftBank Group, the Japanese multinational conglomerate being one the of lead investors.[^3](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lemonade/company_financials#investors)

## Business Activities

Lemonade seeks to change the perception of the insurance industry while turning it from what many may see as a necessary evil and turning it into a social good. By using their incredible quantities of data inputs, Lemonade seeks to offer customer tailored policies meet the specific needs of each individual client for the lowest cost. In doing so, Lemonade not only provides a service but leaves customers with the feeling of satisfaction wrought from finding one of the best deals available. On top of this, Lemonade takes only 25% of the insurance premium revenue for administrative costs and profits while leaving the remaining 75% to fund customer claims, buy reinsurance, and pay various taxes and fees. Anything that is left over is then given to charities that customers are allowed to choose.[^4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/05/02/lemonade-fintech-insurance-unicorn/#2206b6606cde) While the law of large numbers states that with an increase in clients, there will naturally be naturally be more claims that will require Lemonade to pay out, having customers come face to face with the possibility of stealing from charities they chose themselves, Lemonade leaves the onus choosing to falsify claims up to the individiduals. Using pre-existing social strucutes as a way of causing others to police themselves gives the new insurance company a leg up on competitors. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Recommendations

Moving forward, my professional suggestions for Lemonade are to continue its current expansion into the market, regardless of the balance sheet. As of current, Lemonade is not a profitable business. However, it currently places itself in the position to utilize its affordable insurance policies for rent and homeowners as a loss leader strategy. Insurance companies traditionally make significant profits based on an economy of scale. Why accepting a loss on renter's insurance, Lemonade poises to place itself as a true disrupter by using its technological advantage to attract new customers to bundle their insurance policies and take on other offerings. This will lead Lemonade to possess to coveted reoccuring revenue bundle which will increase revenue and make up for losses on the net loss product offerings. 
These big ticket items like auto-insurance and even life-insurance would be added to this bundle in the future and could allow for collaboration or even buy-outs of start-ups that use data driven learning as a means to offer better life-insurance packages to customers. I believe this to be the best and only way forward for Lemonade as an insurance company as they will eventually need to prove their ability to not just generate revenue but turn a profit in order to meet the expectations of shareholders.
